# GraphQL Client for Marvel Authors and Books

## Description
This project is a front-end application built with React or Next.js that uses Apollo Client to interact with a GraphQL server. It provides CRUD functionality for managing a collection of authors and books, as well as search functionality for genre, price range, and author name. The application features modal forms for adding/editing records and a responsive UI with Material-UI components.

## Features
- **Authors Page**: Displays a list of authors with details including name and number of books. Allows for editing and deleting authors, and includes an "Add Author" button with a modal form for adding new authors. Each author name links to a details page.
- **Author Details Page**: Shows detailed information about a single author, including a list of books (up to 3). Includes options to edit or delete the author.
- **Books Page**: Displays a list of books with title, genre, and price. Allows for editing and deleting books, and includes an "Add Book" button with a modal form for adding new books. Each book title links to a details page.
- **Book Details Page**: Shows detailed information about a specific book, including the authorâ€™s name. Also includes options to edit or delete the book.
- **Search Page**: Allows users to search by genre, price range, or author name. Search inputs dynamically change based on the selected query type (e.g., genre, price range, or name).
- **Navigation**: Includes a navbar for seamless navigation throughout the application.
